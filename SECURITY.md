# Security Policy

## Overview

This P2P Coin Flip Betting Game implements multiple layers of security to ensure fair play and protect user data. This document outlines the security measures and best practices implemented.

## Cryptographic Security

### Digital Signatures
- **Algorithm**: Ed25519 elliptic curve cryptography
- **Key Generation**: Cryptographically secure random number generation
- **Message Integrity**: All network messages are digitally signed
- **Identity Verification**: Public key-based player identification

### Random Number Generation
- **Source**: Hardware-backed secure random sources when available
- **Fallback**: Cryptographic PRNG with proper seeding
- **Coin Flip Algorithm**: SHA-256 based deterministic results from combined player seeds
- **Verifiability**: All random seeds are auditable and verifiable

## Network Security

### P2P Communication
- **No Central Server**: Eliminates single points of failure
- **Message Authentication**: All communications cryptographically signed
- **Consensus Mechanism**: 50%+1 validation requirement for all bets
- **Timeout Protection**: Automatic progression prevents network stalling

### Anti-Fraud Measures
- **Identity Binding**: Cryptographic keys tied to player actions
- **Replay Protection**: Timestamp and nonce-based message uniqueness
- **Consensus Validation**: Majority agreement required for bet acceptance
- **Audit Trail**: Complete transaction history with cryptographic proofs

## Data Security

### Local Storage
- **SQLite Database**: Local-only storage, no remote data transmission
- **Key Management**: Private keys stored securely in application directory
- **Data Integrity**: Database constraints and validation rules
- **Privacy**: No personal information required or stored

### History Management
- **Retention**: Automatic cleanup after 100,000 records
- **Indexing**: Optimized queries for performance
- **Backup**: Users responsible for local data backup

## Game Integrity

### Fair Play Mechanisms
- **Transparent Algorithm**: Open source coin flip implementation
- **Collective Randomness**: All players contribute to random seed
- **Deterministic Results**: Verifiable outcomes based on known inputs
- **No Central Authority**: Cannot be manipulated by single party

### Validation System
- **Bet Verification**: Each bet requires majority player validation
- **Time Constraints**: 1-minute betting windows prevent manipulation
- **Double-Spend Prevention**: Cryptographic validation prevents duplicate bets
- **Result Verification**: All players can independently verify game outcomes

## Threat Model

### Mitigated Threats
- **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks**: Cryptographic signatures prevent message tampering
- **Identity Spoofing**: Public key cryptography ensures authentic identity
- **Bet Manipulation**: Consensus mechanism prevents unauthorized changes
- **Result Manipulation**: Collective randomness prevents biased outcomes
- **Replay Attacks**: Timestamp and nonce validation prevents message replay

### Potential Risks
- **Collusion**: Multiple players working together (mitigated by requiring 50%+1 consensus)
- **Network Partitioning**: Players may be isolated from network (timeout mechanisms help)
- **Local Key Compromise**: If private key is stolen, player identity can be impersonated
- **Majority Attack**: If >50% of players collude (inherent limitation of consensus systems)

## Best Practices for Users

### Key Management
- **Secure Storage**: Keep private keys in secure location
- **Regular Backups**: Backup application data regularly
- **Access Control**: Limit file system access to application directory
- **Key Rotation**: Generate new keys periodically for enhanced security

### Network Security
- **Trusted Networks**: Only connect through trusted network connections
- **Firewall Configuration**: Configure firewall rules appropriately
- **Monitor Connections**: Watch for unusual network activity
- **Peer Verification**: Verify you're connected to legitimate game participants

### Safe Gaming
- **Bet Responsibly**: Only bet amounts you can afford to lose
- **Verify Opponents**: Ensure you're playing with legitimate players
- **Monitor Results**: Watch for patterns that might indicate manipulation
- **Report Issues**: Report suspicious behavior to the community

## Security Auditing

### Code Review
- **Open Source**: All cryptographic implementations are reviewable
- **Standard Libraries**: Uses well-tested cryptographic libraries
- **Best Practices**: Follows established security patterns
- **Regular Updates**: Dependencies updated for security patches

### Testing
- **Unit Tests**: Core security functions have comprehensive tests
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end security scenarios tested
- **Penetration Testing**: Regular security assessments
- **Fuzzing**: Random input testing for robustness

## Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly:

1. **Do not** disclose the vulnerability publicly
2. Contact the development team through secure channels
3. Provide detailed reproduction steps
4. Allow reasonable time for fixes before disclosure

## Security Updates

- **Automatic Checks**: Application checks for security updates
- **Notification System**: Users notified of critical security patches
- **Update Verification**: All updates cryptographically signed
- **Rollback Capability**: Ability to revert problematic updates

## Compliance

### Standards
- **NIST Guidelines**: Follows NIST cryptographic recommendations
- **Industry Best Practices**: Implements established security patterns
- **Peer Review**: Code reviewed by security professionals
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive security documentation

### Limitations
- **Educational Purpose**: Designed for educational and simulation use
- **No Real Money**: Does not handle actual financial transactions
- **Local Deployment**: Security model assumes trusted local environment
- **Consensus Dependency**: Security relies on honest majority assumption
